**Grade: Correct**

**Feedback:** Your answer, option B, is correct! Shadows are typically created when light from a source is blocked by an object's presence or shape. This blocking of light can be due to the object's size, shape, or orientation, resulting in the formation of a shadow on the surrounding surface.
       
Well done!

(Note: The other options are incorrect because reflection (A) and refraction (D) refer to changes in the direction of light as it hits a surface, while absorption (C) refers to the absorption of light by a material, neither of which is directly responsible for creating shadows.
